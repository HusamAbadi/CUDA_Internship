#- Meeting With Professor Peter Ivany:
    I told him that I am a bit confused with the flow of the internship and that I need guidance. He suggested me to look into the MatLab program he sent me once called "top88" and to devide it into smaller parts and try to understand each part and convert it to CUDA.
    He also highlighted the chapters that are most important from the book to not spend much time on not so important chapters.
