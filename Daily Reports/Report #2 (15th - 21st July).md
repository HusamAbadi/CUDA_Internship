# Day #8 (July 15th):

#- Book Reading : 45-48 (3.3 A Vector Addition Kernel)

#- Video Wathcing : Intro to CUDA (parts 1-3 ): - By Josh Holloway

-Installed NVIDIA Studio Driver (SD) and CUDA Toolkit 12.5.0.
-Convigured the requrired system environment variables.
-Created the first CUDA Project (ArrayIncrement) as a sample test sbut I was not able to build and execute it.
-Learnt how forloops work in CUDA and learnt about indexing threads within grids and blocks

# Day #9 (July 16th):

#- Book Reading : 48-53 (3.4: Device Global Memory and Data Transfer)

#- Video Wathcing : Intro to CUDA (part 4): Indexing Threads within Grids and Blocks - By Josh Holloway

-I figured how to build and execute the CUDA Project in the first place. I was able to build and execute it successfully. I have also created the github repository for the project.
